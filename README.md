# Predicting-healthcare-cost-for-Health-Management-Organization

Description:
Health Management Organizations (HMOs) are medical insurance companies that provide health care for a fixed yearly fee. The dataset we were provided comprises 14 columns and information on 7,583 persons. The columns cover a wide range of topics, including the individual's unique identity, age, geographic region, gender, education level, marital status, number of children, and healthcare spending. They also inquire about the individual's physical activity, smoking habits, BMI, yearly physical examination status, and hypertension status. Our goal is to to provide actionable insight, based on the data available, as well as accurately predict which people (customers) will be expensive. We need to also identify the key drivers for why some people are more expensive. 

Objective: 
Provide consultancy to Health Management Organisation and our goal is to understand why certain people require more health care and what attributes are responsible for higher healthcare costs. Next, predict the cost for the following year and provide the HMO with tailored guidance on how to lower the cost in order to reduce their total healthcare spending.
